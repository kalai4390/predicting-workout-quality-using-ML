## Introduction

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount
of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantiﬁed
self movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their
health, to ﬁnd patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly
do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In
this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6
participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 diﬀerent ways.

This repository is created as part of the practical machine learning course offered by John Hopkins university @ Coursera.

## Objective

The objective is to predict whether the participants have performed the exercise correctly or not
based on the parameters provided in the dataset.
